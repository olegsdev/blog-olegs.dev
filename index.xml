      <description>Linux containers often considered as something in the middle between a chroot and a full fledged virtual machine. The goal of LXC is to create an environment as close as possible to a standard Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.
LXD is a system container and virtual machine manager. It offers a unified user experience around full Linux systems running inside containers or virtual machines.
Before start, use lxd init to configure LXD settings such as network, storage, clustering and other.</description>

      <description>At the beginning it was just a file server on Raspberry Pi 4 + SSD with installed NextCloud server.
Then I needed a Virtualization Server where I could quickly deploy vm to test various software.
For this I chose KVM - as a hypervisor and LXC(LXD) for lightweight containers. LXC is good for simple servers like Nginx or Mysql, KVM for more complex system like FreeIPA Server, Docker, Kubernetes and others.</description>
