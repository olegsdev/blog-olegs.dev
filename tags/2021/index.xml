      <title>ElastiFlow: Monitoring network traffic with Netflow and ELK Stack and OpenWRT</title>

      <description>Setup NetFlow on OpenWRT NetFlow is a network protocol system created by Cisco that collects active IP network traffic as it flows in or out of an interface. In my case all traffic runs from router with OpenWRT. To activate netflow monitoring we need to install softflowd package.
softflowd - is a software implementation of a flow-based network traffic monitor. softflowd reads network traffic and gathers information about active traffic flows.</description>

      <title>LXD quick start (linux containers)</title>

      <description>Linux containers often considered as something in the middle between a chroot and a full fledged virtual machine. The goal of LXC is to create an environment as close as possible to a standard Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.
LXD is a system container and virtual machine manager. It offers a unified user experience around full Linux systems running inside containers or virtual machines.
Before start, use lxd init to configure LXD settings such as network, storage, clustering and other.</description>

      <title>My Home Lab (v2)</title>

      <description>Idea At the beginning it was just a file server on Raspberry Pi 4 + SSD with installed NextCloud server.
Then I needed a Virtualization Server where I could quickly deploy vm to test various software.
For this I chose KVM - as a hypervisor and LXC(LXD) for lightweight containers. LXC is good for simple servers like Nginx or Mysql, KVM for more complex system like FreeIPA Server, Docker, Kubernetes and others.</description>
